I'm using QCAD to generate these drawings. The steps I took under Linux:

# download the .dwg drawing from SERPAC. It's located in the current directory, named a-31.dwg.

# Convert that file to a form recognizable to QCAD.
   ## download EveryDWG.zip from http://opendesign.com/guestfiles and uzip
   ## run EveryDWG.exe under wine
   ## convert from .DWG to output type R9 ASCII DXF. The file that gets output should be compatible with QCAD.

dimensions - Ardunino panel

pin 28 is located 0.9500" to the east of the the center of the board if looking at it in kicad/pcbnew.

the center of the USB jack is 1.400" to the west of pin 28.
the center of the power jack is (0.384+.030)/2=0.207 to the west of pin 28.

measured width of the Arduino USB jack is 0.477". add 0.015" for tolerance. = 0.492"
measured width of the Arduino power jack is 0.348". add 0.015" for tolerance. = 0.363"
measured height of both Arduino jacks is 0.425". add 0.015" for tolerance. = 0.440"

distance from the bottom of each jack to the channel for the faceplate is 0.200".
